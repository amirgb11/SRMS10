 *   1. `AUTH_SECRET` from the environment — always wins.
 *   2. A random secret persisted in `.srms-secret`, generated on first build.
 *
 * Why persist to a file instead of relying on `.env`?
 * Hosted sandboxes regenerate `.env` on every restart, which silently dropped
 * `AUTH_SECRET` and fell back to the shared hard-coded development key. The
 * file keeps a unique per-installation secret without any manual step.
 *
 * NOTE: the value is inlined at build time, so it is deliberately NOT applied
 * to desktop builds — there the Electron shell injects a per-machine secret at
 * runtime (see desktop/lib/core.js → getOrCreateAuthSecret).
